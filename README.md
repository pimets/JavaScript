JavaScript

Introduction to Javascript

Was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, since 1996 JavaScript has been working on ECMAScript, the standardized javascript.  It’s an interpreted, object-oriented, imperative language used to make webpages interactive for users. It’s possible to integrate API’s at Js for example a geolocation API.  

Where do I write?

  * It can be written inline, internal script, external script (one or many)

   * Inline script


   * Internal script, written in the head or body(preferred) of HTML


External script, creating a *.js file and writing on a IDE for example VS, the source tag could be at the head or the body (preferred) If there are more than one *.js we add more scripts source tags 



# Syntax y Basic Construct

We can check data type using typeof

We have two ways to comment 
Single line commenting
// comenting with this bars left this out of running

Multiline commenting
/*
	This is a 
      multiline	
      comment
*/


* Variables
Variables are containers of data and it’s stored in a memory location. When a variable is declared a memory location y reserved to be filled with the value once is assigned. To declare a variable it’s used let(allows value change) or const doesn't (allow value change) commands, and the old var but its getting old.

A valid JavaScript variable name must follow the following rules:
A JavaScript variable name should not begin with a number.
A JavaScript variable name does not allow special characters except dollar sign and underscore.
A JavaScript variable name follows a camelCase convention.
A JavaScript variable name should not have space between words.


Data types 

In Js we have two types of data: primitives and Non-primitives  

* The primitive data: is the immutable datum represented directly at the lowest level of the language and corresponds to: Boolean type (true/false), Null type (null value), Undefined type (not assigned yet), number type (integer or floating numbers), BigInt type (used on extreme large numbers), NaN type (not a number), string type (represent textual data) and symbol type (unique and immutable primitive values called “atoms”, represents a unique identifier)
Example of a primitive value

* The non-primitive data (includes object and array), 

Non-primitive data types are modifiable or mutable. We can modify the value of non-primitive data types after it gets created. 

An array is a list of data values in a square bracket. Arrays can contain the same or different data types. Array values are referenced by their index. In JavaScript array index starts at zero. I.e., the first element of an array is found at index zero, the second element at index one, and the third element at index two, etc.



An object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier. Objects can be understood like a collection of properties with the object literal syntax properties can be added and removed.

# JavaScript Glossary
APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement.

In interpreted languages, the code is run from top to bottom and the result of running the code is immediately returned without having to transform the code into a different form before the browser runs it.


IDE is an integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).
